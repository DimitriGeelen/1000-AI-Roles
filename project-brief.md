# Project Brief: Role Editor Enhancement

## Problem Statement
Currently editing markdown files in the Claude Code Pair Programming Roles project requires a disconnected workflow - using Claude prompts to edit files, then opening them through a file browser to view changes. This creates inefficiency and lacks a unified interface for managing the project's markdown documentation.

## Target Users
- Primary: Solo developer (project owner)
- Secondary: N/A (personal tool)
- Stakeholders: Project owner only

## Success Criteria
1. Single web page displays all .md files in the project with collapsible previews
2. Inline editing capability with staged changes (not written until committed)
3. Zero external dependencies - fully self-contained solution
4. Works consistently across all platforms
5. Loads and navigates quickly (under 2 seconds for common operations)

## Constraints
- Timeline: Nice-to-have by tomorrow (1 day development)
- Technical: Web-based (HTML/CSS/JS), no frameworks or external dependencies
- Resources: Solo developer time
- Compliance: None

## Assumptions
- File system access will be handled through existing Claude Code capabilities
- Browser compatibility with modern standards is sufficient
- No need for user authentication or multi-user support

## Out of Scope
- External markdown editor integrations
- Version control within the editor (Git operations)
- Syntax highlighting or advanced markdown preview
- File creation or deletion (only editing existing files)
- Non-markdown file support

## Priority Order
0. **Simplicity** - Must be simpler than current workflow
1. **Speed** - Fast loading and navigation
2. **Safety** - Prevent accidental changes with commit/save pattern
3. **Visual Clarity** - Clean, readable interface

## Failure Criteria
- Requires maintenance or breaks easily
- More complex than current workflow
- Platform-specific issues

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Use /mvp-specialist to define the minimal viable solution focusing on core functionality
2. Use /architect to design a simple, maintainable architecture
3. Use /coder to implement with emphasis on robustness and zero dependencies
